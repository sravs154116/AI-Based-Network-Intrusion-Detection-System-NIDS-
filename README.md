# AI-Based Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)

This project presents an AI-powered Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) that uses Machine Learning techniques to detect malicious network traffic. The system is designed as a student project and demonstrates how Random Forest can be applied to real-world cybersecurity problems.

## 🚀 Project Overview

With the increasing number of cyber attacks, traditional rule-based intrusion detection systems are no longer sufficient. This project implements a data-driven approach to analyze network traffic and classify it as either normal or malicious.

The model is trained on the **CIC-IDS2017 dataset**, which contains realistic benign and attack traffic, making the system suitable for academic and practical demonstrations.
